# Buy Low Sell High

You are an amateur day trader who is trading IAG, a mineral exploration company.

On December 12, 2015 at 10 a.m., you determined that IAG was a buying opportunity and bought 10,000 shares at \$1.42 per share; you ended up selling it an hour later (11 a.m.) at \$1.85 per share, generating a profit of \$4,300.

Although a fantastic trade in and of itself, you want to know if you could have possibly made more money.

These were all the prices of IAG at 5-minute intervals on December 12, 2015, between the hours of 10 a.m. and 11 a.m.:

`$1.42, $1.32, $1.45, $1.20, $1.34, $1.74, $1.10, $1.89, $1.42, $1.90, $1.80, $1.85`

Write an efficient function that takes a list of stock prices in chronological order and finds the best trade by calculating the maximum profit through the determination of the minimum (buy) and maximum (sell) stock prices.
